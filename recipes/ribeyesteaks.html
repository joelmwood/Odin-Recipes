    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 oz) boneless ribeye steaks</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch Montreal steak seasoning, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Marinade</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅓ cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 dash liquid smoke flavoring</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place steaks in a flat baking dish or container. Cut slits at 1-inch intervals in the fat around the edges
            of the steaks. Gently pierce both sides of each steak a few times with a fork.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle each steak with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Montreal steak seasoning. Pat seasonings into
            steaks.</li>
        <li>Whisk olive oil, Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, balsamic vinegar, Dijon mustard, garlic, and liquid smoke
            together in a bowl. Pour marinade over steaks to coat. Cover container or baking dish with plastic wrap and
            marinate steaks in the refrigerator for 2 hours. Turn steaks over and marinate for another 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Cook the steaks on the preheated grill until they start to firm, and are reddish-pink and juicy in the
            center, 8 to 10 minutes per side for medium-rare. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
            should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
